Detection of type of diabetes including Decision Tree algorithm in machine learning
We took the dataset of aboout 768 patients which contains different attributes such as blood-ressure,BMI,blood-sugagr-level,etc as the 
deciding factores for diabetes.Diabetes are classified into 2 types in this dataset i,e Type-1 and Type-2.
There are also information about patients who don't have diabetes also present in the diabetes.
We replace the Type-1 diabetic patients as 1 ,Type-2 diabetic patients as 2 and the patients who don't have diabetes as 0
for simplification purposes in our dataset.
We then visalize the data and us our Decision Tree Algorithm for traininng and testing puposes and get our desired results.
